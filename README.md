# HIGHLIGHTS

An implementation of the HIGHLIGHTS algorithm for Agent Policy Summarization: 
#### Amir, Ofra, Finale Doshi-Velez, and David Sarne. "Summarizing agent strategies." Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems 33.5 (2019): 628-644.

The HIGHLIGHTS algorithm requires a Q-value based RL agent.

update the following files for your specific needs:
get_agent.py

get_traces.py

trained agents should be in Agent folder

We provide a working implementation of a ddqn agent in the highway domain.

## Requirements:
gym <= 0.19

### Dependencies:

highway-env - v1.5 - https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env/tree/v1.5

rl-agents - https://github.com/eleurent/rl-agents

## Running
run the file run.py

All hyper parameters are there to control and adjust.
